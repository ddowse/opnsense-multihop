The inital idea for VPN Multihopping Plugin was created by a customer who wants to remain anonymous.
The customer also provided some funds to me to realise his idea for him and the opnsense/vpn community as well. 

Thank you!. 


# Technical Information

1. The Plugin will extract the VPNID and creates a list and stores that information in  `/usr/local/etc/multihop.conf`.
1. The Shellscript `/usr/local/opnsense/scripts/OPNsense/Multihop/multihop.sh` will be executed when the service API triggers `configd`.

   1. The Shellscript will read the list of VPNID's from its own conf file.   
   1. Get's the `server_addr` field  of the next VPNID int the list by using `pluginclt` and parse it with `jq`   
   1. The correct `server_addr` is passed to the `--route-up` script. This adds the GW of the current OpenVPN Tunnel to the routing table for `server_addr`. The  Shellscript skips `--route-up` on the last VPNID and set the routing options from the clients settings. 

The OPNsense OpenVPN Client Configuration is not touched. Altough VPN Clients that are used for mutlihopping should be disabled in OpenVPN->Client or they will 
startup on reboot as this is the default. There is no autostart after reboot yet. 

You will also have  to take care of the *NAT and Filter settings*. Some examples can be found in my other repo [pfSense-pkg-openvpn-multihop](https://github.com/ddowse/pfSense-pkg-openvpn-multihop).
